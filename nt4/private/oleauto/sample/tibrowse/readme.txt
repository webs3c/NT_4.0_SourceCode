Shortcomings of this sample
---------------------------
1. This browser is not suitable for use by end users.  It is
deficient in many ways.  A few of them:
  - Users should never have to know that uuid's exist.  Thus,
	they should not be displayed in a browser.
  - Items that are restricted or that start with underscore
	should not be displayed in a browser.
  - Duplicates for propery get/set pairs should be removed
	since users think about properties, not about get/set 
	pairs.
